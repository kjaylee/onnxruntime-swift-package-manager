# Swift Package Manager for ONNX Runtime

A light-weight repository for providing [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) support for [ONNXRuntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime). The ONNX Runtime native package is included as a binary dependency of the SPM package.


SPM is the alternative to CocoaPods when desired platform to consume is mobile iOS.

## Note

The `objectivec/` and `swift/` directories are copied from ORT repo and it's expected to match. It will be updated periodically/before release to merge the newly checked-in changes for objective-c/swift on ORT main repo.
